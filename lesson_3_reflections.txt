** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? **

I would want to use a remote repository when I'm working with other people or when I'm working in multiple computers on the same project. It would also help if I'm working in an open source project.

** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? **

It may be interesting to pull changes manually in case I want to try some new feature but it's still not ready, where I'm in the middle of trying some new feature of my software but it's a middle step towards a more refined goal.

** Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? **

I would use branches when I want to change a feature of my program but it's still not ready to go into the main program (which should be always running). I would use clone to copy some repository from my remote repository for example when I'm using another computer or even if I want to clone the same program in my local repository. I would use fork when I want to change someone else version of a program but I don't have permission to change it so I would fork their program and make the changes myself in my own remote copy of their remote repository.
